# About Us

Having served across four Administrations and three Cabinet-level agencies, Pete Tseronis maintained a passion for connecting dots, building bridges, and fostering relationships that afforded opportunities to coalesce the Federal Government's technology agenda with private sector investment and entrepreneurial innovation. Now a select group of dynamic colleagues have joined him to form The Tseronis Group and continue his fervor to shepherd the introduction of new technologies
to the marketplace.

Our vision is to create a collaborative continuum of open innovation across the national laboratory, government, industry, and academic eco-systems to ensure Federally-funded research enables a wide range of transformative products and services with broad economic impact.

## Our Leadership
As the Chief Technology Officer for the Department of Energy, and Department of Education, Pete Tseronis worked closely with Americaâ€™s most experienced researchers, entrepreneurs, and technology companies.
 
## Our Mission  
We strive to provide business and government leaders with the same kind of high-level, strategic thinking and diligent execution that empowers our nation's innovators and accelerates technology transfer.
